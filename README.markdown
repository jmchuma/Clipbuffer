All the URLs are added in a new line.

Go to the ![Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kaljanbaemmkahepmddieipmafapobdb "Clipbuffer at Chrome Web Store") and get it!

## How do I use this thing?

Simple. After installing it just use the right click on whatever addess you want
to copy and you should see a new entry in your contextual menu that looks like
this:

![Menu entry for links](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5226030/Clipbuffer/linkMenu.png "Menu entry for links")

Notice the _Add link to clipboard_ mennu? You should click on that to add URLs
to the clipboard without overwriting previous content stored in it. Questions?

**Q:** Yes. What if I just want to copy one URL?  
**A:** Then you should use the _Copy Link Address_ functionality that comes with the browser.

**Q:** And if I already have stuff on the clipboard but I want a fresh start?  
**A:** Use the _Copy Link Address_ functionality to add the first URL. After that just use
the entry provided by the extension.

**Q:** How do I add the URL of the page I'm on right now?  
**A:** Just right click on anywhere aon the page and you should see and option for that.

**Q:** How do I clean the clipboard after usage?  
**A:** The same way you do it whenever you use the clipboard: just overwrite it with
something else.
