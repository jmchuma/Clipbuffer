Clipbuffer for Google Chrome
============================

A Google Chrome extension created to be able to use the "Copy link URL" many
times without having go back and forth from your browser. It is implemented as
context menus. This extension works on:

* Links
* Images
* HTML5 audio tag
* HTML5 video tag

All the URLs are added in a new line.

## How do I use this thing?

Simple. After installing it just use the right click on whatever addess you want
to copy and you should see a new entry in your contextual menu that looks like
this:

You should click on that to add URLs to the clipboard without overwriting
previous content stored in it. Any questions?

**Q:** Yes. What if I just want to copy one URL?  
**A:** Then you should use the _Copy URL_ functionality that comes with the browser.

**Q:** And if I already have stuff on the clipboard but I want a fresh start?  
**A:** Use the _Copy URL_ functionality to add the first URL. After that just use
the entry provided by the extension.

**Q:** How do I clean the clipboard after usage?  
**A:** The same way you do it whenever you use the clipboard: just overwrite it with
something else.

Enjoy!
